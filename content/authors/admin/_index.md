Established in 2021, Henan Institute of Quantitative Economic Information Technology is a new think tank located in the Central Plains region that uses big data and modern econometric methods to analyze social issues and make scientific policy assessments and causal inferences about economic issues in China, especially the economic development of the Central Plains region.

Researchers are the core competence of the think tank. The researchers employed by QERI all have high level academic results published, and their research results have been reported in many high-quality academic conferences such as the annual China Economics Conference.

Under the purpose of serving the country, the society and the people, QERI tries to provide financial and data support as well as necessary academic guidance for the economics research of scholars. From time to time, we call for projects for researchers and give them certain financial support. The Institute advocates scholars to use modern econometric methods such as RDD, DID, and IV to tell the Chinese story. We also invite high-level scholars to co-author review articles in the fields of econometric theory, machine learning, parametric and non-parametric regression.
